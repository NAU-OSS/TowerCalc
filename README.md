# TowerCalc

## Features

- Accurate DPS calculations

- Support for damage-over-time passives (burn, bleed, stacking effects)

- Multi-placement damage modeling

- Filter and compare units by category, element, and passive

- Extensible design for future combat simulation features

---

## Purpose

This project aims to provide a transparent and flexible damage calculation engine for Tower Defense players who want to:

- Compare units objectively

- Optimize team compositions

- Understand passive stacking behavior

- Theorycraft leader skill synergies

## Planned Features

- Full combat simulation (wave-based modeling)

- Enemy resistance & defense scaling

- Team composition optimizer

- Web or GUI interface

- Data import/export tools

## 📦 Installation
